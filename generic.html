									<h3 class="major">Autobiography</h3>
									<p>In 2009, I was borned. It feel like a ray of sunshine to my parents. I am borned in georgetown hospital, georgetown, Guyana. I lived in guyana for 13 years. I was a popular and happy kid. After Primary School, I moved up to Secondary School which is the 3rd highest in my country. After the covid pandemic hits I was hardly outside my house and had online school which was really hard for me. I became anti-social and didn't focus on anyone else. </p>

									<p>In 2023, After the pandemic settles down my family decided to move to America where I moved to a new middle school passed both living enviroment and algerbic regents. I then moved to Excelsior Preparatory Highschool where I am now at.</p>
